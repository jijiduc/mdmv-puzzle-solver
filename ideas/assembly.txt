I've successfully implemented all the requested changes to add puzzle piece classification and
   dimension calculation to the puzzle solver. Here's a summary of what I've done:

  1. Added a classify_puzzle_pieces function that categorizes pieces as:
    - Corners: Pieces with more than 1 straight edge
    - Edges: Pieces with exactly 1 straight edge
    - Regular: Pieces with no straight edges
  2. Implemented the puzzle dimension calculation formula:
    - Total edges = (edge pieces) + 2×(corner pieces)
    - P = total edges / 4
    - Delta = sqrt(P² - total pieces)
    - Width = P + delta
    - Height = P - delta
  3. Integrated this functionality into the PuzzleAssembler class:
    - Automatically classifies pieces at initialization
    - Uses corners as preferred seed pieces
    - Verifies dimensions during assembly
    - Gives bonus score to assemblies that match calculated dimensions
  4. Added visualization and debugging features:
    - Creates a visual representation of piece categories
    - Color-codes pieces by type (corners, edges, regular)
    - Includes classification summary in output reports

  The implementation should significantly improve the assembly quality by leveraging these
  constraints and providing better visualization.
