● Report: Refining the Corner Detection Process

  Current Implementation Analysis

  The current corner detection method has several limitations:

  1. Simple Edge Type Classification: Classifies a piece as a corner if it has more than 1
  straight edge. This binary approach may miss important nuances.
  2. No Confidence Scoring: All edges are treated equally without considering the confidence
  level of each classification.
  3. Limited Geometric Validation: No validation of whether the straight edges form an actual
  corner (i.e., should be approximately perpendicular).
  4. No Sub-type Classification: Does not differentiate between different types of corners
  (e.g., top-left, bottom-right).

  Improvement Recommendations

  1. Enhanced Edge Straightness Metric

  Replace the binary "straight/not straight" classification with a continuous straightness
  score:

  def calculate_edge_straightness(edge_points):
      """Calculate how straight an edge is (0.0 to 1.0)."""
      # Fit a line to the edge points
      vx, vy, x0, y0 = cv2.fitLine(np.array(edge_points), cv2.DIST_L2, 0, 0.01, 0.01)

      # Calculate maximum distance of any point from the line
      max_distance = 0
      total_distance = 0
      for point in edge_points:
          # Calculate distance from point to line
          distance = abs((vy * (point[0] - x0) - vx * (point[1] - y0)) /
                        np.sqrt(vx*vx + vy*vy))
          max_distance = max(max_distance, distance)
          total_distance += distance

      avg_distance = total_distance / len(edge_points) if edge_points else 0
      edge_length = np.linalg.norm(edge_points[-1] - edge_points[0]) if len(edge_points) > 1
  else 0

      # Normalize by edge length to get a relative measure
      relative_max_distance = max_distance / edge_length if edge_length > 0 else 1.0
      relative_avg_distance = avg_distance / edge_length if edge_length > 0 else 1.0

      # Combine into a single score (0 = very curved, 1 = perfectly straight)
      straightness = 1.0 - min(1.0, (relative_max_distance * 0.7 + relative_avg_distance * 0.3))

      return straightness

  2. Corner Angle Validation

  Add angle validation between adjacent straight edges:

  def validate_corner_angle(edge1_points, edge2_points):
      """Validate that two edges form a corner with approximately right angle."""
      # Calculate direction vectors for the edges
      if len(edge1_points) < 2 or len(edge2_points) < 2:
          return False

      vec1 = edge1_points[-1] - edge1_points[0]
      vec2 = edge2_points[-1] - edge2_points[0]

      # Normalize vectors
      vec1 = vec1 / np.linalg.norm(vec1)
      vec2 = vec2 / np.linalg.norm(vec2)

      # Calculate the angle between the vectors (dot product)
      dot_product = np.dot(vec1, vec2)
      angle = np.arccos(np.clip(dot_product, -1.0, 1.0))
      angle_degrees = np.degrees(angle)

      # Check if angle is approximately 90 degrees (with tolerance)
      is_right_angle = abs(angle_degrees - 90) < 20

      return is_right_angle, angle_degrees

  3. Corner Type Classification

  Determine corner orientation (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right):

  def classify_corner_type(piece_data):
      """Classify the corner type (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right)."""
      # Find the two straight edges
      straight_edge_indices = [i for i, edge_type in enumerate(piece_data['edge_types'])
                             if edge_type == "straight"]

      if len(straight_edge_indices) < 2:
          return "not_corner"

      # Get directions of the straight edges
      directions = []
      for edge_idx in straight_edge_indices:
          edge_points = piece_data['edge_points'][edge_idx]
          if len(edge_points) < 2:
              continue

          start, end = edge_points[0], edge_points[-1]
          direction = np.arctan2(end[1] - start[1], end[0] - start[0])
          directions.append(direction)

      # Classify corner type based on directions
      sorted_directions = np.sort(directions)
      angle_diff = (sorted_directions[1] - sorted_directions[0]) % (2 * np.pi)

      # Simplified classification (can be improved with more precise angle calculations)
      if 0 <= sorted_directions[0] < np.pi/2 and np.pi/2 <= sorted_directions[1] < np.pi:
          return "top_left"
      elif np.pi/2 <= sorted_directions[0] < np.pi and np.pi <= sorted_directions[1] <
  3*np.pi/2:
          return "top_right"
      elif np.pi <= sorted_directions[0] < 3*np.pi/2 and 3*np.pi/2 <= sorted_directions[1] <
  2*np.pi:
          return "bottom_right"
      else:
          return "bottom_left"

  4. Revised Piece Classification Function

  Improve the classification function with confidence scores:

  def classify_puzzle_pieces_refined(piece_results):
      """
      Refined classification of puzzle pieces with confidence scores.
      
      Returns:
          Dictionary {piece_idx: {"category": category, "confidence": confidence, "type": 
  corner_type}}
      """
      piece_categories = {}

      for piece_idx, piece_data in enumerate(piece_results):
          if 'edge_types' not in piece_data or 'edge_points' not in piece_data:
              piece_categories[piece_idx] = {
                  "category": "unknown",
                  "confidence": 0.0,
                  "type": None
              }
              continue

          # Calculate straightness scores for all edges
          edge_straightness = []
          for edge_points in piece_data['edge_points']:
              straightness = calculate_edge_straightness(edge_points)
              edge_straightness.append(straightness)

          # Find edges with high straightness scores (threshold can be tuned)
          straight_edge_indices = [i for i, score in enumerate(edge_straightness) if score >
  0.85]
          straight_edges_count = len(straight_edge_indices)

          # Calculate average straightness of straight edges as confidence
          straight_confidence = np.mean([edge_straightness[i] for i in straight_edge_indices])
  if straight_edge_indices else 0

          # Validate corners by checking angles between straight edges
          is_valid_corner = False
          corner_angle = 0

          if straight_edges_count >= 2:
              # Check pairs of straight edges to find a valid corner
              for i, j in combinations(straight_edge_indices, 2):
                  is_right, angle = validate_corner_angle(
                      piece_data['edge_points'][i],
                      piece_data['edge_points'][j]
                  )
                  if is_right:
                      is_valid_corner = True
                      corner_angle = angle
                      break

          # Classify with confidence
          if straight_edges_count > 1 and is_valid_corner:
              category = "corner"
              corner_type = classify_corner_type(piece_data)
              confidence = straight_confidence * 0.8 + (1.0 - abs(corner_angle - 90) / 90) * 0.2
          elif straight_edges_count == 1:
              category = "edge"
              corner_type = None
              confidence = straight_confidence
          else:
              category = "regular"
              corner_type = None
              confidence = 1.0 - max(edge_straightness) if edge_straightness else 0.5

          piece_categories[piece_idx] = {
              "category": category,
              "confidence": confidence,
              "type": corner_type
          }

      return piece_categories

  5. Improved Assembly Integration

  Update the assembly process to leverage the refined corner information:

  1. Start with High-Confidence Corners: Prioritize corners with highest confidence scores.
  2. Corner-Specific Placement: Place corners in grid positions matching their types (e.g.,
  top-left corner in the upper-left of the grid).
  3. Connection Validation: When connecting pieces, validate that the connection maintains the
  calculated puzzle dimensions.

  Implementation Impact

  The refined corner detection system would provide several benefits:

  1. Higher Accuracy: More precise classification of corners with confidence scores.
  2. Better Initial Placement: Correct positioning of corners based on their types.
  3. Dimensional Consistency: Better enforcement of calculated dimensions.
  4. Reduced Assembly Attempts: Fewer incorrect placements due to misclassified corners.

  Implementation Priority

  1. Edge Straightness Metric: Implement this first as it provides the foundation for the other
  improvements.
  2. Corner Angle Validation: Critical for validating true corners.
  3. Corner Type Classification: Important for correct initial placement.
  4. Revised Classification Function: Integrates all previous improvements.
  5. Assembly Integration: Updates the assembly process to use the new information.

  Conclusion

  The current corner detection process can be significantly improved by moving beyond binary
  classification to a more nuanced approach that considers:

  - Continuous straightness scores
  - Angle validation between straight edges
  - Corner type classification
  - Confidence-based decision making

  These improvements would help resolve the discrepancy between calculated and assembled
  dimensions by providing more accurate constraints for the assembly process.
