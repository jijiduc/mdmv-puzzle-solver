   Hausdorff Distance and Procrustes Analysis

  Hausdorff Distance

  The Hausdorff distance measures how far two subsets of a metric space are from each other,
  making it excellent for comparing edge contours.

  How it works:
  1. For each point on edge A, find the closest point on edge B
  2. Take the maximum of all these minimum distances
  3. Repeat steps 1-2 in reverse (B to A)
  4. The Hausdorff distance is the greater of these two maximums

  Mathematical definition:
  H(A,B) = max(h(A,B), h(B,A))
  where:
  h(A,B) = max_{a∈A} min_{b∈B} ||a-b||

  Benefits for puzzle matching:
  - Handles irregular edge shapes naturally
  - Accounts for all points along both edges
  - Detects even small misalignments that might be missed by simpler methods
  - Provides a single distance metric that captures overall shape similarity

  Implementation in puzzle context:
  For edge matching, you would:
  1. Sample points along both edge contours
  2. Compute the Hausdorff distance between these point sets
  3. Normalize by edge length for fair comparison between edges of different sizes
  4. Convert the distance to a similarity score (smaller distance = better match)

  Procrustes Analysis

  Procrustes analysis is a statistical method that finds the optimal transformation
  (translation, rotation, scaling) to superimpose one shape onto another.

  How it works:
  1. Align the centroids of both shapes
  2. Find the optimal rotation that minimizes the sum of squared distances between corresponding
   points
  3. Optionally scale one shape to match the other
  4. Calculate the remaining difference after alignment as the similarity measure

  Mathematical approach:
  1. Centered coordinates: subtract centroid from each point
  2. Calculate optimal rotation matrix using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
  3. Apply rotation and compute residual differences

  Benefits for puzzle matching:
  - Handles different orientations automatically
  - Provides a measure of how well edges fit after optimal alignment
  - Accounts for small variations in edge shape that might be due to manufacturing tolerances
  - Works well for complementary shapes (like puzzle tabs and slots)

  Implementation in puzzle context:
  For edge matching, you would:
  1. Extract point sets representing each edge
  2. Flip one edge to account for the complementary nature of matching edges
  3. Apply Procrustes analysis to find optimal alignment
  4. Use the residual (minimum achievable distance after alignment) as your matching score

  Both methods are significantly more powerful than simple edge type classification because they
   consider the complete geometry of the edges rather than reducing them to broad categories
  like "intrusion" or "extrusion".

   Implementation Priority

  1. Backtracking (High): Will immediately improve assembly by allowing recovery from suboptimal
   placements
  2. Dynamic Threshold (High): Easy to implement and allows progress even with uncertain matches
  3. Multiple Starting Points (Medium): Helps find better initial configurations
  4. Rotation Support (Medium): Important for flexibility but more complex to implement
  5. Global Constraints (Low): More complex but provides refined placement decisions
