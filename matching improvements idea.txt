Potential Improvements for Edge Matching

  1. Use Contour Matching: Implement more sophisticated contour matching techniques like
  Hausdorff distance or Procrustes analysis to better compare edge shapes beyond simple
  intrusion/extrusion classification.
  2. Machine Learning for Feature Extraction: Train a model to learn what makes edges compatible
   by providing examples of correctly matched pieces, potentially using siamese networks to
  compute similarity scores.
  3. Improved Spatial Color Analysis: Adapt the spatial sampling density based on edge length to
   ensure consistent feature resolution, and weight samples by their position (e.g., focus more
  on middle sections where distinctive patterns often occur).
  4. Contextual Edge Matching: Consider neighboring edges when scoring matches, since real
  puzzles often have color themes or patterns that continue across multiple pieces.
  5. Texture Features: Add texture descriptors (LBP, GLCM features) to better capture patterns
  beyond color histograms, especially useful for areas with similar colors but different
  textures.
  6. Corner Compatibility Scoring: Add specific scoring for how well corner regions align
  between matched edges, as corners often have distinctive features.
  7. Gradient Direction Matching: Compare the direction of color gradients across potential
  matches, not just their magnitude, to ensure transitions align correctly.
  8. Global Puzzle Context: Introduce a global constraint system that considers the overall
  puzzle state and improves scores for matches that fit logically in the emerging image.
  9. Adaptive Weighting: Dynamically adjust the shape/color weight ratio based on piece
  characteristics (e.g., more weight on shape for highly distinctive edges).
  10. Rotational Invariance: Add support for considering rotated pieces by comparing edges at
  different orientations.
  11. Ensemble Matching Approach: Combine multiple matching algorithms and feature sets, using a
   voting or weighted ensemble to improve accuracy.
  12. Backtracking Assembly: Implement backtracking in the assembly algorithm to escape local
  optima when initial high-scoring matches lead to poor overall results.

   Hausdorff Distance and Procrustes Analysis

  Hausdorff Distance

  The Hausdorff distance measures how far two subsets of a metric space are from each other,
  making it excellent for comparing edge contours.

  How it works:
  1. For each point on edge A, find the closest point on edge B
  2. Take the maximum of all these minimum distances
  3. Repeat steps 1-2 in reverse (B to A)
  4. The Hausdorff distance is the greater of these two maximums

  Mathematical definition:
  H(A,B) = max(h(A,B), h(B,A))
  where:
  h(A,B) = max_{a∈A} min_{b∈B} ||a-b||

  Benefits for puzzle matching:
  - Handles irregular edge shapes naturally
  - Accounts for all points along both edges
  - Detects even small misalignments that might be missed by simpler methods
  - Provides a single distance metric that captures overall shape similarity

  Implementation in puzzle context:
  For edge matching, you would:
  1. Sample points along both edge contours
  2. Compute the Hausdorff distance between these point sets
  3. Normalize by edge length for fair comparison between edges of different sizes
  4. Convert the distance to a similarity score (smaller distance = better match)

  Procrustes Analysis

  Procrustes analysis is a statistical method that finds the optimal transformation
  (translation, rotation, scaling) to superimpose one shape onto another.

  How it works:
  1. Align the centroids of both shapes
  2. Find the optimal rotation that minimizes the sum of squared distances between corresponding
   points
  3. Optionally scale one shape to match the other
  4. Calculate the remaining difference after alignment as the similarity measure

  Mathematical approach:
  1. Centered coordinates: subtract centroid from each point
  2. Calculate optimal rotation matrix using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
  3. Apply rotation and compute residual differences

  Benefits for puzzle matching:
  - Handles different orientations automatically
  - Provides a measure of how well edges fit after optimal alignment
  - Accounts for small variations in edge shape that might be due to manufacturing tolerances
  - Works well for complementary shapes (like puzzle tabs and slots)

  Implementation in puzzle context:
  For edge matching, you would:
  1. Extract point sets representing each edge
  2. Flip one edge to account for the complementary nature of matching edges
  3. Apply Procrustes analysis to find optimal alignment
  4. Use the residual (minimum achievable distance after alignment) as your matching score

  Both methods are significantly more powerful than simple edge type classification because they
   consider the complete geometry of the edges rather than reducing them to broad categories
  like "intrusion" or "extrusion".
